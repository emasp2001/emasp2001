### Hello / Pura Vida / Salut / 你吃了吗 ! 🙋🏻‍♂️

My name is Emmanuel and I'm a student of _Computer Science_ student at [University of Costa Rica](https://www.ucr.ac.cr). You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emanuel_solis20) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-solis-527904154/).

I think of my self as a nerd 🤓 because honestly I like studying and the baddest think I do is drink soda. I am a christian, I live in [Costa Rica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica) (Pura Vida) 🇨🇷  but I enjoy visiting the United States 🇺🇸 ; a few things about me:

- One of my favorites versicles, John 11:25 📖
- Speak english 🇺🇸 and spanish 🇪🇸

#### Currently studying on my own 🔬
- Cyber Security
- Learning chinese 🇨🇳 and french 🇫🇷 
- NFC
- Radio Frequencies
- Software Defined Radio (SDR)

#### Extra knowledge 📖  
- Creating documents with LaTex.
- Debugging with GDB.
- Implementation of SageMath, Knirt for mathematical solutions.
- Probability and Statics.

You can find generic code that I have learn in my time in the university with their algorithm details, I uploaded it thinking in others students around the world who are struggling with similar practices.

Althought I do not have a personal website for the moment [this one](https://www.iasdhatillo.org) gets to be one of my favorities. I can be helpful if you have an issue with Latex, Markdowns, SageMath or programming thopics so feel free to write me an email at emmanuel.solisp@icloud.com; and I recently open a [DEV](https://dev.to/emasp2001) account, so hope to be uploading code here too.
